# Inferred Vision

## 1. The Problem

Government agencies and national organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia face significant challenges in managing and disseminating official information to their stakeholders. Traditional communication channels are fragmented, with news, multimedia content, official documents, and internal communications spread across multiple disconnected systems. This fragmentation leads to several critical issues.

First, there is a **lack of centralized information access**. Stakeholders, including government employees, partner organizations, and the public, must navigate multiple platforms to find official news, policy documents, video briefings, and reference materials. This creates inefficiency and increases the risk of misinformation.

Second, **content management workflows are cumbersome**. Without a unified platform, the process of creating, reviewing, approving, and publishing official content requires manual coordination between content creators, moderators, and administrators. This slows down the dissemination of time-sensitive information.

Third, **visibility and engagement are limited**. Organizations lack a comprehensive analytics framework to understand how their content is consumed, which topics generate the most interest, and how effectively they are reaching their target audience.

Fourth, **role-based access control is inadequate**. Sensitive internal documents and member-exclusive content require granular access controls that are difficult to implement across disparate systems.

## 2. The Solution

The Rasid National Platform ("منصة راصد الوطنية") addresses these challenges by providing a **unified, modern, and feature-rich digital platform** that consolidates all aspects of organizational communication and content management into a single, cohesive system. The platform's name, "Rasid" (راصد), which translates to "Observer" or "Monitor" in Arabic, reflects its mission to serve as a comprehensive monitoring and information dissemination hub.

The solution is architected around several key pillars.

**Unified Content Hub.** The platform consolidates six distinct content types — news articles, videos, images, guides/documents, presentations, and curated links — into a single portal with consistent navigation, search, and discovery capabilities. Each content type has its own dedicated section with specialized viewing experiences, such as a presentation viewer with slide navigation and a media gallery with HD download options.

**Structured Content Lifecycle Management.** The platform implements a complete content lifecycle, from creation through approval to publication. Content creators (Editors) draft articles and upload media using a rich text editor (Tiptap). Content Moderators review submissions through a dedicated approval queue, with the ability to approve, reject, or request revisions. Administrators can schedule content for future publication and control the display order of items on the platform.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).** The system supports seven distinct user roles — Admin, Content Moderator, Editor, Viewer, User, Moderator, and Member — each with precisely defined permissions. Content visibility can be configured at the item level, with options for public access, member-only access, or restriction to specific user IDs.

**Internal Communication System.** A built-in messaging system enables direct communication between users and broadcast messaging from administrators. Real-time notifications keep users informed of new content, messages, and system events.

**Analytics and Reporting.** A comprehensive analytics dashboard provides administrators with insights into content performance, user engagement, registration trends, and activity patterns. Automated weekly reports can be configured and delivered via email.

## 3. Target Audience

The Rasid National Platform is designed to serve multiple stakeholder groups within a government or national organizational context.

| Audience | Description | Primary Use |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Government Administrators** | Senior officials and system administrators within the organization (e.g., NDMO — National Data Management Office) | System configuration, user management, analytics review, and overall platform governance |
| **Content Teams** | Editors, writers, and content moderators responsible for creating and curating official communications | Content creation, review, approval, scheduling, and publication |
| **Internal Staff / Members** | Employees and registered members of the organization who need access to internal resources | Accessing member-exclusive content, guides, presentations, and internal communications |
| **Partner Organizations** | External government agencies and partner entities (e.g., NIC — National Information Center) | Accessing shared resources, official announcements, and collaborative content |
| **Public Visitors** | The general public seeking official information and news from the organization | Browsing public news, videos, image galleries, and official links |

## 4. Strategic Alignment

Based on the domain context (references to NDMO — National Data Management Office, and NIC — National Information Center in user data), the platform appears to be strategically aligned with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 digital transformation initiatives. It serves as a digital communication backbone for national data governance organizations, enabling transparent, efficient, and modern information dissemination practices.

The platform's bilingual support (Arabic-first with RTL layout using the Tajawal font family) and its deployment on a modern cloud infrastructure demonstrate a commitment to both cultural authenticity and technological excellence.
