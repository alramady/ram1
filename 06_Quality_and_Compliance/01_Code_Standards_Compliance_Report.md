# Quality and Compliance

## 1. Code Quality and Standards

The project maintains a high standard of code quality through a combination of modern development tools and established best practices. The frontend is built with **React 19** and **TypeScript**, leveraging **Vite** for a fast and efficient development experience. Code consistency is enforced using linters and formatters, ensuring readability and maintainability. The use of **TailwindCSS** with **Radix UI (shadcn/ui)** provides a robust and consistent styling foundation.

## 2. Content Moderation and Approval Workflow

A comprehensive content moderation and approval system is in place to ensure the quality and appropriateness of all published materials. This workflow is managed through a dedicated admin panel and involves several stages:

- **Submission**: Editors and contributors can submit content, such as news articles and videos, through the platform.
- **Review**: Content moderators review submissions for accuracy, quality, and adherence to guidelines.
- **Approval/Rejection**: Moderators can approve or reject content, providing feedback to the submitter.
- **Scheduling**: Approved content can be scheduled for publication at a specific date and time.

This entire process is supported by the `approval` and `scheduling` tRPC procedures, which interact with the `news` and `videos` database tables to manage the status of each content item.

## 3. User Roles and Permissions

The platform utilizes a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions and responsibilities. This ensures that users only have access to the features and data necessary for their roles. The defined roles include:

| Role                | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`             | Full access to all platform features, including user and content management. |
| `content_moderator` | Can review, approve, and reject content submissions.                        |
| `editor`            | Can create and submit content for review.                                   |
| `viewer`            | Can view published content.                                                 |
| `user`              | Basic user with limited permissions.                                        |
| `moderator`         | General moderation capabilities.                                            |
| `member`            | Access to member-exclusive content and features.                            |

This granular permission system is crucial for maintaining the quality and integrity of the platform's content.

## 4. Compliance and Best Practices

The Rasid National Platform adheres to modern web development best practices to ensure a secure, reliable, and high-performance user experience. Key compliance-related features include:

- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication is handled via **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, a secure and industry-standard method.
- **Data Integrity**: The use of **Drizzle ORM** with a **MySQL/TiDB** database ensures data consistency and integrity.
- **Accessibility**: While not explicitly detailed in the analysis, the use of modern UI libraries like **Radix UI** suggests a commitment to accessibility best practices.
- **Error Handling**: The presence of an `ErrorBoundary` component in the frontend indicates a proactive approach to handling and reporting errors, improving the overall user experience.
